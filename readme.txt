Integrate your Printify orders with WooCommerce using API. Thiw will allow you to sell your products on Printify and get orders in your store along with your WooCommerce orders.

== Description ==

Plugin uses [API key authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys) via HTTP headers (X-API-Key) to authenticate requests from Printify.
At the moment plugin only supports fixed printing price (this means that printing price does not depend on different areas).

Printify will not be able to update the order as soon as any of the products statuses inside the order are set to Anything else but Created. During this stage the order is considered as taken into Production and only shipping related information can be updated.
As soon as any of the items are marked as Packaged or Shipped - shipping related information is no longer updatable from the side of Printify API. Only Order ID can be updated no matter the order status.
